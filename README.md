# Chess Engine

This is a personal project to build a chess engine that I call BasicCarp.
The goal is to create a working chess application that I can play against as either White
or Black. The initial goal is simply to have a functioning chess engine, and a further goal is to make
it sufficiently strong to beat me.

I am trying to do this in order to develop my python skils, and to learn how to proffessionaly structure a project.

## Project Goals
- Build a working chess interface
- Implement a simple board representation and move generator
- Create a basic evaluation function
- Implement a simple search algorithm (minimax with alpha–beta pruning)
- Support playing full games as either White or Black

## Current Status
- Project structure initialised
- Working on GUI

## Planned Components
- Board representation and move generation
- Game loop and user input handling
- Evaluation function
- Search algorithm (minimax / alpha–beta)
- Transposition tables, opening database, maybe AI evaluation (future)

## Design Principles
- Keep the engine simple and understandable
- Write modular, testable code
- Avoid premature complexity

## Future Extensions
- Improve evaluation heuristics
- Add transposition tables
- Integrate an opening database
- Performance profiling and optimisation

## Motivation
This project is intended as a learning exercise combining algorithms, mathematics, and
software design, and as a foundation for more advanced work later on.
