# Chess Engine

This is a personal project to build a minimal, playable chess engine from first principles.
The goal is to create a working chess application that I can play against as either White
or Black, while developing the core components of a chess engine step by step.

The focus of this project is correctness, clarity, and learning — not performance or strength
(at least initially).

## Project Goals
- Build a working chess interface (initially text-based, GUI later)
- Implement a simple board representation and move generator
- Create a basic evaluation function
- Implement a simple search algorithm (minimax with alpha–beta pruning)
- Support playing full games as either White or Black

## Current Status
- Project structure initialised
- Core design and architecture planning

## Planned Components
- Board representation and move generation
- Game loop and user input handling
- Evaluation function (material + simple positional heuristics)
- Search algorithm (minimax / alpha–beta)
- Optional GUI and opening database (future)

## Design Principles
- Keep the engine simple and understandable
- Prefer correctness over optimisation
- Write modular, testable code
- Avoid premature complexity

## Future Extensions
- Improve evaluation heuristics
- Add transposition tables
- Integrate an opening database
- Performance profiling and optimisation
- Optional graphical interface

## Motivation
This project is intended as a learning exercise combining algorithms, mathematics, and
software design, and as a foundation for more advanced work later on.
